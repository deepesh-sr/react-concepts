# ðŸ›’ React Shopping Cart with useMemo Hook

This is a fun little project where I built a shopping cart in **React** and used the **`useMemo` hook** to make it faster!

> Imagine if your mom asked you to add up your toy prices again and again every time she changed her mind about snacks ðŸ˜…. Instead, you write it down once and only redo it if the toy list changes. Thatâ€™s what `useMemo` does.

## ðŸ’¡ What is useMemo?

> `useMemo` is like a smart memory that remembers your homework answers until the question changes.

In this project, I used `useMemo` to:
- ðŸ§® Calculate the total price of the cart
- ðŸ’¸ Apply a 10% discount only if a coupon (`SAVE10%`) is added

## ðŸ§  Why is this important?

React components re-render a lot. If we do heavy math every time, it becomes slow.  
With `useMemo`, React **remembers** the answer â€” just like a calculator that stores your last result!
