# React Hooks Examples

A collection of React hooks examples with practical demonstrations.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## How to Use

Each hook concept is organized in its own folder with example components. To see any example in action:

1. Import the component in [`src/App.jsx`](src/App.jsx)
2. Add it to the JSX return statement
3. View the result in your browser

## Available Examples

- **useMemo**: [`useMemo/ShoppingCart.jsx`](useMemo/ShoppingCart.jsx) - Demonstrates memoization for expensive calculations

## Coming Soon

More hook examples will be added covering useState, useEffect, useCallback, useContext, and other React hooks.
